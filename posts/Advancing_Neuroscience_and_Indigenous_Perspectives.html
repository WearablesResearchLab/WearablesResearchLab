        <p>This past week, our discussions explored the intersection of neuroscience, Indigenous knowledge, and theoretical frameworks for advancing brain research. Here’s a summary of the key themes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Relational Quantum Physics and Te Ao Māori</li>
</ol>
<p>We delved into the overlaps between relational quantum physics and te ao Māori (the Māori worldview). Key concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interconnectedness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mauri (life force)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whakapapa (genealogy)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>…offer a rich lens for understanding complex systems like the brain. These insights have the potential to inform new paradigms that integrate cultural and scientific perspectives in neuroscience.
2. Sound, Standing Waves, and Microtubules</p>
<p>We revisited the theoretical role of sound and standing waves in neural function. In particular, microtubules, as integral components of neural structures, may:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Act as conduits for targeted ultrasound stimulation (TUS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Offer insights into consciousness and brain function</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This aligns with emerging biophysical models and lays the groundwork for future experimental research.
3. Indigenous Cosmologies and Neuroscience</p>
<p>A major highlight was our ongoing exploration of how Indigenous cosmologies can enrich brain research. By examining the synergy between cultural frameworks and scientific methods, we aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Foster more inclusive research models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broaden our understanding of the mind from diverse epistemological perspectives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Challenges in Publishing and Protecting IP</li>
</ol>
<p>A practical issue arose around balancing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The need to publish findings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The need to protect intellectual property</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We discussed a strategy of submitting theory-driven content to conferences like EMBC 2025 while safeguarding proprietary methods—allowing us to contribute meaningfully to the field without compromising innovation.</p>
<p>This week’s discussions reaffirmed the value of interdisciplinary thinking and the importance of integrating diverse perspectives into our work. These theoretical insights will continue to shape our research direction.</p>
