title: "Weekly Insight: Bridging Neuroscience, Physics, and Indigenous Knowledge"
date: "2025-02-10"
description: "This week, our theoretical discussions continued to push the boundaries of neural engineering, exploring the intersections of targeted ultrasound stimulation (TUS), quantum biology, and indigenous knowledge systems."

1. Refining the Theoretical Framework for TUS

Building on previous discussions, we further developed the hypothesis that Targeted Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) interacts with microtubules through standing waves, potentially influencing neural function at a fundamental level. This approach aligns with emerging quantum biological models and may provide new pathways for non-invasive brain modulation.
2. Indigenous Perspectives on Neural Connectivity

We examined whakapapa (genealogy) and mauri (life force) from te ao Māori as conceptual tools for understanding networked systems in the brain. These perspectives provide a holistic framework that aligns with modern complexity science, reinforcing the value of interdisciplinary approaches in neuroscience.
3. Intellectual Property and Publication Strategy

A key challenge remains balancing open scientific discourse with IP protection. Following discussions with an IP lawyer, we are refining our strategy to:

    Publish theoretical work without compromising proprietary methods

    Inform upcoming papers and potential submissions to EMBC 2025

4. Experimental Next Steps and Research Priorities

    Craig is working to determine peak pressure at focus and optimize voltage inputs for TUS

    We are seeking access to a hydrophone to validate models and calibrate the system

Looking Ahead

    Finalize the theoretical framework for our upcoming publication

    Advance experimental validation of TUS pressure dynamics

    Continue recruitment efforts for research support in physics and mathematics

This week’s discussions reaffirm the value of blending theoretical insight, experimental rigor, and cultural perspectives.
