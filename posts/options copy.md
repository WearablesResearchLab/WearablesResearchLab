#### 1. Ryan's Setup

- Markdown style notes in obsidian
- Guide setup
- Static html is generated using python,  (already setup)
- can create a shortcut to run the python bat converted file, so its just a click of a button.
- syncing with github
- we setup a github page for the lab with shared access.

Cost: Just the domain


There are other alternative's like Jekyll, Cloud FIrebase, but they are funnels into paid tiers, or are restrictive.
