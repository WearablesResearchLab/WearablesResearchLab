<li>Shifting Focus – From Lab Prototype to Wearable Platform</li>
</ol>
<p>We refined the theoretical framework supporting a real-time closed-loop EEG-TUS system. The new focus is delivering a miniaturised, personalised device to help users achieve optimal cognitive states under pressure.</p>
<p>Key theoretical insights:</p>
<pre><code>Ultrasound stimulation must adapt to individual EEG signatures over time

The system must maintain a responsive real-time feedback loop

The concept of flow, from both Western cognitive science and mātauranga Māori, informs the timing and nature of stimulation
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Applying Quantum Biophysics Principles</li>
</ol>
<p>With Chris onboard as theoretical lead, new models are emerging to explain how ultrasound interacts with microtubules and other sub-cellular structures.</p>
<p>These quantum-biophysical discussions:</p>
<pre><code>Explore intersections between quantum vibrations, bioelectric activity, and cellular structure

Shape the adaptive learning algorithms behind personalised brain-state stimulation
</code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>IP and Publication Strategy Discussions</li>
</ol>
<p>As we prepare for external pilots, protecting core IP is now critical. This week, we clarified how to separate:</p>
<pre><code>- Publishable theoretical work (e.g., quantum biophysics, EEG markers of flow)

- Proprietary algorithms (e.g., real-time EEG-based TUS steering)

- Culturally derived stimulation waveforms (blending acoustic science with Māori knowledge)
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Upcoming Milestones</li>
</ol>
<p>Theoretical discussions informed the following goals for next quarter:</p>
<pre><code>- Complete hydrophone testing and k-Wave simulation validation

- Integrate machine learning models for detecting flow and fatigue states

- Prepare for pilot testing with F1 and HPSNZ athletes

- Define a usable and intuitive UX for athletes in high-pressure environments
</code></pre>
<p>Closing Reflections</p>
<p>This week’s theoretical progress reinforces the need to design for both technical precision and practical usability. By grounding the system in cutting-edge science and performance realities, the Ngā Waiata o te Wairoro project continues to evolve as a Māori-led, culturally-informed neurotechnology platform with global impact.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for next week’s update, including progress on our VC pitch and Innovation Office review.</p>
