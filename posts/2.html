        <p>Weekly Research Update – Bridging Neuroscience, Physics, and Indigenous Knowledge</p>
<p>This week, our discussions have continued to bridge neuroscience, physics, and Indigenous knowledge, refining our approach to Targeted Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) and its implications for brain function. Below are the key insights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Defining Intellectual Property Boundaries in Research</li>
</ol>
<p>A major focus has been balancing publication with IP protection. Following our meeting with the IP lawyer, we are refining strategies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Share theoretical frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safeguard proprietary methodologies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will directly influence our upcoming paper and future conference submissions.
2. TUS and Microtubule Interactions</p>
<p>Building on previous discussions, we further explored the hypothesis that TUS can influence microtubules through standing waves. This concept is crucial for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developing novel neuromodulation techniques</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aligning with emerging biophysical models in quantum biology</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Indigenous Knowledge and Neuroscience</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuing our interdisciplinary approach, we examined how concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whakapapa (genealogy)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mauri (life force)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>from te ao Māori can offer alternative perspectives on neural function and connectivity. These ideas may inform novel models of consciousness and brain dynamics.
4. Experimental Next Steps</p>
<pre><code>- Craig is determining peak pressure at focus and optimizing voltage inputs for TUS applications

- We are following up on hydrophone acquisition, critical for validating theoretical predictions through experimental data
</code></pre>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>Next steps include:</p>
<pre><code>- Finalizing a publishing strategy with Greg

- Beginning to draft a theoretical paper for submission

- Advancing TUS validation experiments and securing required equipment

- Recruiting additional research support to accelerate development
</code></pre>
<p>Our work continues to evolve at the intersection of neuroscience, physics, and Indigenous knowledge. Stay tuned for further updates!</p>
