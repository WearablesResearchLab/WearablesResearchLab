        <p class="post-description">This week, our theoretical discussions continued to push the boundaries of neural engineering, exploring the intersections of targeted ultrasound stimulation (TUS), quantum biology, and indigenous knowledge systems.</p>

<li>Refining the Theoretical Framework for TUS</li>
</ol>
<p>Building on previous discussions, we further developed the hypothesis that Targeted Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) interacts with microtubules through standing waves, potentially influencing neural function at a fundamental level. This approach aligns with emerging quantum biological models and may provide new pathways for non-invasive brain modulation.
2. Indigenous Perspectives on Neural Connectivity</p>
<p>We examined whakapapa (genealogy) and mauri (life force) from te ao Māori as conceptual tools for understanding networked systems in the brain. These perspectives provide a holistic framework that aligns with modern complexity science, reinforcing the value of interdisciplinary approaches in neuroscience.
3. Intellectual Property and Publication Strategy</p>
<p>A key challenge remains balancing open scientific discourse with IP protection. Following discussions with an IP lawyer, we are refining our strategy to:</p>
<pre><code>Publish theoretical work without compromising proprietary methods

Inform upcoming papers and potential submissions to EMBC 2025
</code></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Experimental Next Steps and Research Priorities</p>
<p>Craig is working to determine peak pressure at focus and optimize voltage inputs for TUS</p>
<p>We are seeking access to a hydrophone to validate models and calibrate the system</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<pre><code>Finalize the theoretical framework for our upcoming publication

Advance experimental validation of TUS pressure dynamics

Continue recruitment efforts for research support in physics and mathematics
</code></pre>
<p>This week’s discussions reaffirm the value of blending theoretical insight, experimental rigor, and cultural perspectives.</p>
