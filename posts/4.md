description: "This past week, our discussions have centred on the transition from proof of concept to a fully wearable EEG-TUS device designed for elite athletes and drivers. This pivot—strongly supported by new partnerships with Formula 1 and High Performance Sport NZ—has provided clarity around system design and commercial direction."

1. Shifting Focus – From Lab Prototype to Wearable Platform

We refined the theoretical framework supporting a real-time closed-loop EEG-TUS system. The new focus is delivering a miniaturised, personalised device to help users achieve optimal cognitive states under pressure.

Key theoretical insights:

    Ultrasound stimulation must adapt to individual EEG signatures over time

    The system must maintain a responsive real-time feedback loop

    The concept of flow, from both Western cognitive science and mātauranga Māori, informs the timing and nature of stimulation

2. Applying Quantum Biophysics Principles

With Chris onboard as theoretical lead, new models are emerging to explain how ultrasound interacts with microtubules and other sub-cellular structures.

These quantum-biophysical discussions:

    Explore intersections between quantum vibrations, bioelectric activity, and cellular structure

    Shape the adaptive learning algorithms behind personalised brain-state stimulation

3. IP and Publication Strategy Discussions

As we prepare for external pilots, protecting core IP is now critical. This week, we clarified how to separate:

    - Publishable theoretical work (e.g., quantum biophysics, EEG markers of flow)

    - Proprietary algorithms (e.g., real-time EEG-based TUS steering)

    - Culturally derived stimulation waveforms (blending acoustic science with Māori knowledge)

4. Upcoming Milestones

Theoretical discussions informed the following goals for next quarter:

    - Complete hydrophone testing and k-Wave simulation validation

    - Integrate machine learning models for detecting flow and fatigue states

    - Prepare for pilot testing with F1 and HPSNZ athletes

    - Define a usable and intuitive UX for athletes in high-pressure environments

Closing Reflections

This week’s theoretical progress reinforces the need to design for both technical precision and practical usability. By grounding the system in cutting-edge science and performance realities, the Ngā Waiata o te Wairoro project continues to evolve as a Māori-led, culturally-informed neurotechnology platform with global impact.

Stay tuned for next week’s update, including progress on our VC pitch and Innovation Office review.
