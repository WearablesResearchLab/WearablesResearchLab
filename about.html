    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="about_summary">
      Te Kura Rau Mahara is an interdisciplinary research group that works with biosignals and wearable technology for the empowerment of people.
It is a collaboration between Human Centred Computing (HCC), School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, School of Engineering, Te Kotahi Research Institute, School of Health, and the AI Institute.

Te Kura Rau Mahara aims to prioritize and recognise the contribution of Māori knowledge in all academic disciplines; conduct research that prioritizes people through a focus on biosignals; and create a space dedicated to innovation, interdisciplinary research and collaboration.

        <h4>Detecting Cognitive Fatigue with Wearable Sensors</h4>
        <p>Ryans Masters project focuses on creating and analyzing a multimodal dataset using wearable sensors,
          including EEG, ECG, EMG, EDA, and IMU, to detect cognitive fatigue. This multimodal dataset will then be used
          to identify unique patterns linked to cognitive fatigue using Machine Learning.</p>

        <p>
          My research project focuses on developing an EEG-based cognitive state classifier for a closed-loop
          neuromodulation device. The aim is to reliably differentiate between flow and default cognitive states by
          optimizing digital signal processing and deep learning techniques.
