        <h4>Detecting Cognitive Fatigue with Wearable Sensors</h4>
        <p>Ryans Masters project focuses on creating and analyzing a multimodal dataset using wearable sensors,
          including EEG, ECG, EMG, EDA, and IMU, to detect cognitive fatigue. This multimodal dataset will then be used
          to identify unique patterns linked to cognitive fatigue using Machine Learning.</p>

        <h4>Decoding Minds: Uncovering Features of Flow</h4>
        <p>
          My research project focuses on developing an EEG-based cognitive state classifier for a closed-loop
          neuromodulation device. The aim is to reliably differentiate between flow and default cognitive states by
          optimizing digital signal processing and deep learning techniques.
